# BO3/T7-MixTweaks

MixTweaks are a set of random tweaks I like for the game, meant to be used in conjuction with [t7patch](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7patch) or [BO3Enhanced](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/BO3Enhanced), which means this project ONLY works on either of them, unless a feature is specified to not work on one.

Currently features:
- cg_fovscale (ini)
- Unlocked console
